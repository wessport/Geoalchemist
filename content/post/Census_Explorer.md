Why Census Data?

It's used for everything. Census data is routinely relied on for urban planning, regional transportation projects, evaluation of proposed economic developments, solid waste planning, and determining legislative boundaries. That's just a small sampling of why you might need census data.

A common complaint I heard from people working with census data was that it was time consuming and frustrating searching for on the census website.

As part of a capstone project for my Master's program, I worked on making census data more accessible for regional planners at the Greater Nashville Regional Council. I created a Shiny Application in R that allows users to explore common census variables and export them to CSV for further analysis.
