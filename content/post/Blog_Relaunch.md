# Writing Again #

It's been a busy 2 years. A lot has changed - new city, new projects. I want to carve out time for important things again like writing. Already have a few ideas in the works that I hope to post in the coming months. 

##### Potential Topics #####
- Working in Tech
- Life in Austin, TX?
- Getting started with Elasticsearch
- Scraping sites with Python & Scrapy
- Kepler and other cool mappy things
- Neat raster tricks with GDAL
- New Age of Remote work 
- Contributing to Open Source projects
