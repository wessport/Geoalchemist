      <description>An Example of how to use R to Generate Crop Growth Curves 
In between finishing up my database coursework, I’m usually doing remote sensing work.
Most of what I’ve been working on lately is an attempt to create crop phenology curves. In a nut shell phenology curves are just a measurement of crop growth throughout the year.
This post is just a quick code-along which shows you how to generate phenology curves using R.</description>
